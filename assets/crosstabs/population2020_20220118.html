<p class="crosstext"><b>TOTAL POPULATION CHANGE</b></p>
<p class="crosstext">
Census 2020 state level results were released in April
2021. The results showed that Colorado’s resident
population as of April 2020 was 5,773,141 ranking it
21st in size in the US. Colorado’s 2020 population
represents growth of 744,518 or a 14.8 percent
increase over Colorado’s 2010 Census population.
Colorado’s 2010‐2020 growth percentage was the
sixth‐highest among U.S. states. Utah, Idaho, Texas,
North Dakota, and Nevada saw a larger percentage
increase in population. The growth rate of 14.8% is
slower than the previous two decades and one of
the slowest growth rates on record. Although the
growth rate was slower this last decade, the total
growth was similar to the previous decade of 727,935.
</p>

<p class="crosstext">
The growth between 2019 and 2020 is
estimated to have slowed to 48,000 with
net migration slowing to 27,300 and
natural increase slowing to 20,600. Births
remained flat at 62,800 and deaths
increased to 42,000 – over 4,000 higher
than the previous year due to COVID‐19.

<div class="crosstab_content_row">
<p class="crosstext"><i>Births</i></p>
<p class="crosstext">
Births continue to slow in both Colorado
and the U.S. even though the population
of women of childbearing age is
increasing. Changes in births have been
driven by declines in births to younger
mothers. Average age at first birth in U.S is
27. In 2020, over half of all births in
Colorado were to mothers ages 30 and over.
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
For 2020, births were projected decline during the pandemic ‐ ‐ and they did. The total fertility rate hit an all‐time
low in 2020, below 1.5 in Colorado and 1.6 for the US. Replacement levels are 2.1 and the US averaged 2.0 from
1990‐2010, but has been dropping annually since 2010. The slowing in births will have long‐run impacts on K‐12
and higher education, as well as the labor force. The State Demography Office is expecting births to be slightly
lower in 2021 and then return to levels observed in
2019. The largest group of Millennials are entering
their 30s which is the age when Colorado has
experienced increased birth rates.
</p>
<p class="crosstext"><i>Deaths</i></p>
<p class="crosstext">
Over time, the number of deaths in Colorado have
increased, reflecting an increased number of older
adults. COVID‐19 has caused an additional increase in
deaths in 2020 and 2021. Life expectancy at birth
declined 1.5 years last year as a result of the pandemic,
experts are expecting a small increase in 2021, but not
quite a return to 2019 life expectancy estimates. Life
expectancy had generally increased from 2000 through
2019. Female life expectancy continues to be higher
than male, but the increase through 2019 had been
slightly higher for males than females. However, life
expectancy has declined by almost 2 years for males
during the pandemic.
</p>
<p class="crosstext"><i>Migration</i></p>
<p class="crosstext">
Net migration to the state has declined during the
pandemic continuing a slowing that started in 2015.
International migration was down 70% as compared to
the average level from 2010‐2018 in both 2019 and
2020. In 2020, domestic migration slowed 35% relative
to the average between 2010 and 2019.

<p class="crosstext"><b>CHANGE BY COUNTY 2010 to 2020</b></p>
<p class="crosstext">
From 2010 to 2020, 95% of the population growth was along the Front Range, compared to the previous decade where
it was 78%. Denver led the growth over the decade increasing by over 112,000. El Paso is the largest county at 731,641
and Broomfield had the fastest growth rate of 32.7%.

<div class="crosstab_content_row">
<p class="crosstext">
The fastest growing counties (in terms of percent growth) were also
along the Front Range except for Mineral, a smaller
mountain county, ranked 4th highest growth rate with an
increase of 24 people. Although Colorado’s population
has increased by 744,000 between 2010‐2020, 16 of the
counties observed declines over this period. For
comparison, between 2000 and 2010, seventeen counties
declined in population.
