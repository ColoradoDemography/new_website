<p class="crosstext">
Colorado is in the midst of a demographic transition. While Colorado is still one of the youngest states in the country, its population of older adults is increasing rapidly.
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
Based on the American Community Survey, the percentage of Colorado’s population age 60 and older increased from 13 percent in 2005 to 22 percent in 2023.  
The state with the largest percentage of persons age 60 and older, Florida, saw an increase between 22 percent in 2005 and 29 percent in 2023.
</p>
<p class="crosstext">
In 2023, the population 60 years and over in Colorado surpassed 1.3 million, and is expected to grow to 1.5 million in 2030. 
Between 1990 and 2012, the population 60 and over doubled, and the population is expected to double again between 2012 and 2044, 
at which time one in four people in the state will be 60 years and over.

More facts about Colorado’s population:
<ul>
	<li class='accordion_link'>From 2023 to 2033, Colorado's total population is expected to grow by 11.2%, and the population 60 years and over is expected to increase by 20.0%, which is the highest of all age groups.</li>
	<li class='accordion_link'>Older adults are becoming a larger share of the total population because they are a larger generation than in the past, but also because of decreases in the number of births making the population under 18 years a smaller share.</li>
	<li class='accordion_link'>The growth in the 60 years and over age group will be due to Colorado residents aging into the group rather than older adults moving to Colorado.</li>
	<li class='accordion_link'>In the next 10 years, the growth of the 75 to 84 age group will be much larger than the growth in the 65 to 74 age group.</li>
	<li class='accordion_link'>Every county in the state is different in terms of its age distribution.  Some counties attract older adults or retirees, while other counties will have an increase in older adults due to aging in place.</li>
